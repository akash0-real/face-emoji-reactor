🐒 Monkey Gesture Reactor

A fun real-time camera app that reacts to your gestures using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and animated monkey GIFs.
Different monkey reactions are shown based on what gesture or facial expression you make in front of your webcam — like raising your hands, putting a finger to your mouth, or sticking your tongue out!
